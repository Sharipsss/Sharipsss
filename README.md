- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sharipsss
- 👀 I am interested in programming, website development, 
  Front-End and Back-End code development. I also want 
  to learn how to develop software, start learning more 
  programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, PHP.
  
  Also, as you may have noticed, I don't know English 
  very well, and I want to fix it shortly.
  
- 🌱 I already know HTML and CSS quite well, but I 
  still don't know how to responsively layout websites. 
  I am currently learning JavaScript.
  
- 💞️ I want to cooperate on the development of sites and 
  software for Personal Computers
- 📫 You can reach me on Telegram @Sharipsss and Instagram 
  @Sharipsssss. I live in Uzbekistan, Tashkent city. I'm 
  still in school, but it's not that important when you 
  know what you want
